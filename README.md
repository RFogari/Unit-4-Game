# Unit-4-Game
This project was to create an interactive game for web browsers using the JQuery library.  The goal of this game is for the player to match the randomly generated “lucky number” using the four dice images.  Each dice image is assigned a random value for that game.  When the player clicks an image, the value of that image will be added to the total player guess amount.  If the player clicks the right combination of images to match the lucky number, the player will win.
